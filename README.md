# Scaling Data Science in Python with Spark and Ray


## Getting Started

To run locally in a docker container ðŸ‘‡

```
make jupyter
```

or 

```
docker run -p 8888:8888 -p 8265:8265 -p 8000:8000 -p 8089:8089 -v $(pwd):/home/jovyan/ --pull 'always' psychothan/scaling-data-science
```

Then open a web browser to the URL it spits out (the Jupyter server in the container uses [token authentication](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/security.html))
